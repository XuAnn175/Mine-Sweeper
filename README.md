# 2 JavaScript Games Implementation [(Game Link)](https://xuann175.github.io/XuAnn.github.io/)

Welcome to 遊戲天堂 (Game Paradise), a collection of classic games reimagined for the web. This repository hosts two beloved games: Minesweeper and Wordle, each crafted with care to offer an engaging and nostalgic gaming experience.

## Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a test of patience and strategy. The goal is to clear a minefield without detonating any mines. With each click, you reveal what is hidden underneath the square: a number indicating the number of mines in the adjacent squares, or a mine which ends the game. The game offers different difficulty levels to challenge both beginners and seasoned players.
